        %p
          Help spread the blockchain idea across the globe!
          With a token, you can become part of the community around
          You can join Entropy on various events that will be organised around the world, you can take part in the decision-making of where Entropy will go to next and make more proposals!
        %p
          Entropy is a global experiment for digital decision making and cooperativsm that is now made possible with Ethereum.
          We will refine the workings of the Entropy DAO as we test it, resulting in a DAO template that is useful for anyone that wants to base their DAO on the same values of equality and fair distribution of power.
          All while the crew logs what is happening in videos, posts and pictures!
        %p
          Have a look below at the outline of our crowdfund and the goals that we want to achieve.
